In this app, i want to be able to
 - set timers in different categories
 - use a set of user defined tasks and due dates to predict how long something will take and when they should be done
	- the user should be able to define if a task should be done in one go or split up into sections
		e.g. sleeping or showering would be done in one go, whereas studying shoud be split up as much as possible
 - create personalised timetables based on what the user wishes to do by what time
	- the user would select a task and due date
	- if the task has to 
	- if the user wants to allocate a certain amount of time to something without ristrictions on when they're done, the app should
		- disregard


Types of tasks
 - set tasks 			| these tasks have a set start and end
	- they can be individual tasks, or can repeat in intervale
		- e.g. the tasks you can set in normal calendar apps
 - simple tasks 		| tasks that are finished in one go
 - extended tasks (goals) 	| tasks that are finished over multiple instances

Attributes of tasks

 - start date/time 	(optional)
	- if this is set without an end date
		- the user will have to notify the app when the task has ended

 - end date/time	(optional)
	- if this is set without a start date
		- if the app has some idea how long the task will take (either user defined or from previous instances of the same task)
			- the app should find free time before the due date and schedule the task
				- it should also be possible to set alarms in intervals before and when the task should be started

 - priority		(optional)
	- if the priority is not set, the app will assume that the task is immutable
	- if the user tries to allocate more tasks than there is time for
		- the app should drop the lower priority tasks and notify the user of what was dropped
			- these lower priority tasks should be kept on standby, so that if plans are changed, they can be reinstated
		- if you have too many tasks with a high (same) priority, so none can be dropped and no more time can be allocated
			- the user should recieve a notification that
				- there isn't enough time in the day
				- they should reconsider something in their timetable
